# Bank-Management-System
This is the simple console application made using OBJECT-ORIENTED-PROGRAMMING(OOP) and File handling concepts in C++.
This is a simple project where you can implement a banking system which has following features:

* Account management: Create and Delete accounts.
* Deposit amount.
* Withdraw amount.
* Balance enquiry.
* Modify existing accounts.
* List all accounts.

The program is really simple, we have a Class name ‘account’ where we have all the required methods each for implementing a feature.
